# docker-librarian-quay

A [Librarian](https://codeberg.org/librarian/librarian/) image, on Quay.

[Quay page](https://quay.io/repository/pussthecatorg/librarian) |Â [GitHub page](https://github.com/PussTheCat-org/docker-librarian-quay)

This image mostly exist for the [PussTheCat.org](https://pussthecat.org/) [instance](https://librarian.pussthecat.org/), but others are free to use it.

This image was made because, even though the project is abandoned and "dead", it still works. However, since the project was archived no "fresh" image was built, which mean that the upstream image is potentially vulnerable. This image is just a drop in replacement for the upstream image, rebuilt at a regular interval so that it never is vulnerable (at least, outside off the software itself).


## Usage:

- Download (or copy the content of) the `docker-compose.yml` 
- Download (or copy the content of) the `config.yml` from this repository, or from upstream: https://codeberg.org/librarian/librarian/src/branch/main/config.example.yml
- Customize the `config.yml` file how you want 
- Move both files to the folder you want
- `docker-compose up -d`
